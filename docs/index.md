# Staying On Top of 2025

This is a repository of resources and some light commentary to help you stay on top of 2025 and beyond. Resist autocracy. Resist authoritarianism. Resist despotism. Resist fascism. Resist bigotry. Resist technofeudalism.

Do you work for wages or salary? Are you unemployed? Are you disabled? Total assets below $1 billion dollars? Then you are in the same class as everyone else reading this, and subject to the same existential threat, you may just not be feeling the effects yet. That is by design. The more finely they divide us, the harder it is for us to do anything.

## About This Repository

This repository is generally in support of those living in the USA. Are you outside the US? Your future is at risk from what is happening here. The economy is global. The USA's military reach is global. Fascism and extreme right-wing views are becoming more popular everywhere. You can support yourselves, and us, by divesting from the USA: <https://robertreich.substack.com/p/how-our-global-friends-can-help>

This repository is open to addition, modification, and maintenance. Feel free to suggest justifications and commentary. I am open to transforming this readme into a `mkdocs`-style resource.

Keep it civil. Alt-right-style subversions and arguments from bad faith are not tolerated. Requests should be supported with proposed solutions, assertions with evidence, and complaints with alternatives.

As someone with mounting long-covid symptoms, this is my way of fighting back.
